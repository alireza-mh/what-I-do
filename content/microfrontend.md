### Why and soution for micro frontend

so why would we need micro frontend as a first place. Imagine a scenario that you work at enterprise team and some teams responsible for some parts of application in frontend for example some team works on banner and some other team works on footer application. Here how you can have both applications inside one without depending too much on each team to assemble all parts and build whole app again for production release. In some these cases its getting more crazy than this and some teams may work on other technologies for this example imagin banner team works mainly with `vue` framework and other teams works with `react` now it's getting much more complex than just assembling and import other apps inside one big application.
